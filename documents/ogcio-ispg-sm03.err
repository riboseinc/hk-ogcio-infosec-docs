This changes the mode of Internet usage and also brings together new risks in daily operations. While mobile devices and mobile applications (apps) installed in the devices bring convenience and improve efficiency, insecure protection of mobile devices or insecurely written mobile apps pose risks to mobile users and may cause data loss or reputation damage to the app owner. In view of the extra risks introduced by mobile devices due to its high portability, wireless connection capabilities and diverse techniques in mobile app development, this practice guide is developed to provide guidance notes for Bureaux/Departments (B/Ds) to make reference in securing the use of mobile devices in their business and the development of mobile apps for business use.</p>

Information security management is a set of principles relating to the functions of planning, organising, directing, controlling, and the application of these principles in harnessing physical, financial, human and informational resources efficiently and effectively to assure the safety of information assets and information systems.
	Information security management involves a series of activities that require continuous monitoring and control. These activities include but not limited to the following functional areas:</p>

While there are many obvious advantages with these devices, they also bring security concerns that need to be addressed. Also, while mobile apps bring much convenience to users, poorly written mobile apps increase risk of data loss. This section highlights the security measures and best practices to address the common security concerns and illustrates how they should be incorporated in the major stages of mobile device management life cycle and mobile app development life cycle. B/Ds may select and map the security measures and best practices to their own management and development life cycle model based on their business needs.</p>

Mobile devices often need additional protection because their nature generally places them at higher exposure to threats than other client devices, such as a workstation in the office area. Major threats to mobile devices can come from the device itself, network (e.g. mobile, internet) or application (e.g. mobile app, mobile web app). The security concerns of mobile technologies are highlighted below:</p>

	<p id="_a7cd9d71-529c-4564-920a-fa29351ceb0f">The methodology on software development is evolving with new development style such as agile software development, DevOps / DevSecOps (compounding “development”, “security” and “operations”) for continuous integration and continuous delivery to build mobile apps faster and/or more secured using an iterative development process. It focuses on continuous communication, integration, measurement and delivery to foster the processes between app development, testing and quality assurance.

This has come to be known as containerisation, the securing of business apps and their associated data within digital containers (either physical or virtual) that govern app behaviour and prevent unauthorised interaction with personal apps.</p>
	<p id="_91a3d9bd-ecc9-4ebd-bf27-5fe34ff323eb">With the various container offerings from different vendors, there are three main types of containerisation, namely, physical container, virtual container and per-app container.</p>
	<clause id="_physical_container" obligation="normative"><title>Physical Container</title><p id="_642ba831-91f2-4c12-bd72-f9799f547271">Working at the chipset or kernel level of a mobile device to separate business apps and their data from a user’s personal apps. Physical containers creates hardware level segmentation between a mobile user’s business environment and personal environment. Implying a separate OS stack at the kernel level just for business apps to reside and operate. This OS stack is completely distinct from the mobile device’s normal OS stack where the users’ regular apps reside. As it is a separated domain, administrators can enforce organisation specific security requirements to that particular “Physical Container”. A key security aspect of physical containers is that the OS stack typically has to leverage processor-specific capabilities.</p>
	<p id="_187abb87-c27d-41c4-90d7-8912e59c4a83">One of the biggest benefits offered by physical containers is the top to bottom secure isolation that they offer between the separate OS stack and the device’s normal OS stack, ensuring that no interaction can occur between business and personal apps. Since it is a separated platform, the vulnerability will not inherit from mobile device.</p>
	<p id="_27e9ff56-8b67-48be-a96b-6c76088d6fb0">However, this stack-level isolation also creates one of the major drawbacks inherent to physical container solutions—disruption of the user experience. Whenever users are logged into the mobile devices’ normal OS stack, they have to exit and enter into the separate OS stack anytime they want to use a corporate app. When they want to use a personal app, they have to reverse the process. The constant switching between physical containers not only creates user inconvenience, but also would affect user productivity over an extended period of time. Currently, this kind of solution is OS dependent; third-party and internal software developers have to customise the application to support the physical container.</p></clause>
