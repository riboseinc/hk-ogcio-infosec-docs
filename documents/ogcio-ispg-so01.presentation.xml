With these capabilities, most of the current network printers can be used for more than just printing; they can also be used for copying, scanning, faxing and emailing documents. Some of the network printers even have internal servers or routers. Hence, network printers are similar to other computer equipment which could be suffered from various types of security threats (e.g. data leakage) if they are not properly protected / used.</p>
<p id="_85eeebfe-0ef9-4dee-97b4-68d5579f71a5">This practice guide is developed to provide guidance notes for Bureaux/Departments (B/Ds) to make reference in securing the use of network printers in their offices.</p>

Common security considerations and best practices on major stages of network printer management life cycle for using network printers are provided in this document. B/Ds should consider the security measures and best practices recommended in this document and implement adequate security protection for their network printers. This document should be used in conjunction with the established government requirements and documents including Baseline IT Security Policy [S17], IT Security Guidelines [G3], relevant procedures and guidelines, where applicable. In addition to the government security requirements, B/Ds should assess the security risks before the adoption of network printers based on their business needs.</p>
